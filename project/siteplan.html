                <h2>Why I chose this theme</h2>
                <p>
                    The reason as to why I chose this theme for my project is beacuse I've found a recent interest in finding the perfect shave! I've always had trouble with shaving; I woukd get cuts, razor burn, dry skin, and it just generally was an unpleasant expirience. Especially when I had very few and cheap materials and tools. So now I've been looking for better things to improve my shave and I think this webpage can be a good medium to show what I have found and what works for me!

                    <h3>What type of blade gives the best shave?</h3>
                    <p>Usually you can find the best shave from either saftey razors or straight razors. Both however have a noticable learning curve and require some technique to master.</p>
