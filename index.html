                <p>Hello! My name is Ethan Atkinson. I am currently a student attending BYU through the BYU Pathway Program. I am an aspiring software developer and potential web developer! I have always found an interest in working with technology ever since I was a kid. That interest carried me into working with robotics and software throughout my years in junior high and high school. During that time, I took coruses that specialized in Vex robotics, programming languages like Java, C++, Python, and even physics. After serving a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, I found a further passion for work in the software and web development field. I discovered that BYU offers a degrees such as Software Development and an IT Professional Degree. Ever since then, I have been pursuing the Software Development Degree, while approaching the qualifications for the Web & Computer Programming Certificate.</p>

                <p>I recognize that I am very fortunate to come from a background like mine! I have lived in Utah all my life. I attended Roy High School and the Weber Innovations Center for more specialized courses in programming. I have a younger brother and a younger sister that I find myself being continuously grateful for. Some of the things that I like to do when I am not debugging or getting a webpage up and running is hunting, hiking, camping, 3D rendering and printing, cast iron cooking, and of course gaming! Some of my favorite games to play at the moment are Battlefront II, Helldivers II, Valheim, No Man's Sky, and Inscryption!</p>

            <h2>Aside Section</h2>
            <p class="aside-text">Throughout my somewhat limited time and expirience working with software and being involved in the web development process, I have done a great deal of learning! Most often, I find myself learning more than one new thing every day. A lot of the learning that I have done comes from breaking stuff, trial and error, and hours of debugging and wondering why it doesn't (or does) work. But thankfully, I have a few resources that have helped me and are currently helping me get over this sometimes steep learning curve.</p>
            <p class="aside-text">I have a few of the resources that I frequent listed below. These are probably very popular amongst novice and seasoned programers alike. They have come in handy to help me remember the 10,000 little things about different languages. And overall, I feel comfortable crediting these sites for making my personal learning and programming accelerate. </p>
